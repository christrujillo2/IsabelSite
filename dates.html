        <p>Easily agreed to be one of our favorite memories together. I keep telling you how I remember on the drive to
          the desert while you were sleeping how confident I was
          that you were going to be mine. Despite my nerves, I just knew we were too perfect and it obviously makes
          infinitely more sense for us to work out than not. I had no
          fear of my family meeting you knowing that you're the most personeable, charming, and sweet girl that I had
          ever met. Getting to dance with you this night is still some
          of the most fond memories I have with you and continued to illustrate to me the perfect girl that you are.
          Seeing this pictures perfectly puts me back in the place where I was obsessed with you (and definitely falling
          in love) and hoping so badly
          that you felt the same.

          was having fun while I was there but the whole time I would just count the seconds until I could be on my way
          to you. I was able to finally show you PV (your second home now) and have
          you convince me that you were a flat earther. I still remember how beautiful you looked when I first saw you
          in your white sweater as I was already obsessed with you in white
          at that point from seeing it on your instagram. It was literally like seeing a dream in real life to me. I had
          such a good sunset and dinner with you as well as a great time hiking the next day.
          Even just studying in a cafe and running errands with you for the rest of the day meant everything to me in

          beautiful girl in the world with me. I was so nervous and excited
          to bring you your presents yet I felt no shame looking like a simp who is a obsessed with their girlfriend
          walking up the hill in a suit with flowers (I was obsessed obviously).
          Despite the overly long busride, I had the best time with you ever at the formal. Dancing with you is always

          this dinner are the incredible pictures I got of you. You looked so beautiful and mogged me disgustingly, it's

        <p>Another day that I was extremely excited to plan and do with you (very common). Once I decided to take you to
          a cat cafe I got sooo excited so once
          you guessed what it was I was so scared. I wanted it to be a huge surprise to you but im glad we both ended up
          enjoying it so much. I had such a great time there
          with you that I would even consider going back to a cat cafe again with you. I enjoyed our dinner (you
          completely put me to shame with the birthday dinner you got me)
          but I wish they did something for your birthday like I asked :(. My favorite part of it all though was
          surprising you the next day in my room with balloons and all your gifts.
          I remember it was such a scramble to get done but I'm so happy with the way it turned out. I just wish the
          cake box didn't get thrown out by someone (me) so that you could've
          had more cause it was lowkey buss.

          had so much fun going to dinner with you and I am
          infinitely appreciative of the effort. The restaurant was perfect and beautiful with the food being
          unnecessarily good. Your gifts were also beyond amazing. When I
          saw that you made a custom vinyl I was so blown away by how heartfelt it was. I love displaying it in my room
          with the picture of us from fred again.. so everyone could
          see. Anytime anyone asks about it they are always shocked by how sweet of a gift it is. Lego you is so
          important to me and I love carrying her around with me everywhere.
          I had a feeling you'd get me those shoes but I was still so shocked and happy when it happened. Even though my
          perception of you is so perfect you're stil always able to
          exceed my expectations. I love you so much forever sweetie, thank you.

          and I felt so lucky to even be in your vicinity. It sucks we couldn't get a pumpkin that night but it was

          Exploring Powell's with you was surprisingly fun and it's super lucky for us that we accidently discovered.
          The feeling of first being in Oregon with you was incredible so I wanted to make sure to capture it

          so cute and you got me the mushroom! I know I kept saying this but I just couldn't help but picture that
          mushroom in our shared bedroom one day. I always fantasize about
          us shopping for our place together and I definitely believe this mushroom is a part of that. Our dinner was
          also insanely buss, I keep thinking about my "healthy" salmon
          pasta regularly. Also the most important part about this date... the birth of Peewee! Our favorite BOY came
          from here so I'll always have a special attachment to this date.
