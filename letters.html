          <h2 class="display-6">I really wanted to write this to let you know how happy you make me and how much you mean to me.
            Every second with you has been pure joy and i make sure to never take you for granted. I genuinely feel like the luckiest
            boy in the world to get to get to know you like this and i hope to always make you the happiest. You’re so incredibly special
            to me and i’m always looking forward to the next time i see u whether it’s working together, bedrotting, errands, or nice dates.
            you always give me the best time ever and i’m super excited for everything we do in the future</h2>

          <h2 class="display-6">My sweetest Isabel,</h2>
          <h2 class="display-6">
            These past 2 weeks despite being sad to be so far and disconnected from you, have shown me just how deeply i’m falling in love with
            you and how much you mean to me. Every time one of us would wake up and text the other I would genuinely be smiling so hard that I
            get to talk to my perfect girl and hear from her even just a little. It’s shown me how much of a perfect home you are for me and
            how badly I want to do everything with you. Every time we talk about the future I genuinely get so excited as I see it all with
            you so clearly and confidently. The connection i’ve made with you felt so right so fast and it gets even deeper every single day.
            I know that you’re my dream girl and you make me want to do anything for you. It’s been the greatest privilege in the world to be
            with someone who simultaneously perfectly matches my personality while also being the sweetest girl in the world. Every second with
            you is my greatest treasure and i’m constantly excited for my future that I get to always keep you in. You’re a dream Isabel, always.</h2>

          <h2 class="display-2">Birthday Letter - September 22, 2024</h2>
          <h2 class="display-6">My perfect sweetie Bel,</h2>
          <h2 class="display-6">
              I know that you said your birthday is not a big deal to you but to me it is as you are something infinitely worth celebrating. The joy that you bring to my
              life and the others around you is something that most people don’t get to experience in a lifetime. Every time you laugh and smile I just feel the happiest
              I ever could and it makes me just want to squeeze you and never let go. I can’t explain the privilege that it is to be yours and to be able to be so
              welcomed by you, your friends, and your family. I love every piece of you endlessly and I know deep in my heart you are deserving of so much. Even though
              it’s your birthday, you are always a gift to me and you never seem to stop giving. I can’t wait to keep celebrating for many more birthdays to come as well
              as any other chance I get (all the time). </h2>

          <h2 class="display-2">Thanksgiving Letter - November 28, 2024</h2>
          <h2 class="display-6">My gorgeous forever sweetie Bel,</h2>
          <h2 class="display-6">
            I wanted to write you this little card to try and demonstrate the best that I could how important and special you are in my life. You are seriously the most
            beautiful thing in the universe and you just radiate that to everyone around you whether or not you believe it. My admiration and love for you grows every single
            day as we get more and more “comfortable” (in the best way possible) with each other every single day. I love how gross and honest we could be with each other
            as it’s exactly what I would want from someone who I could rely on for anything from. I never can let you think i’m getting “used to you” or “tired” of you as
            that is disgustingly far from the truth as I somehow just love you more and more everyday. It seemed impossible but you’re somehow an even brighter light in my
            eyes than you were months ago and it continues to grow every day. It makes the happiest boy in the world to know I can call you my best friend and the love of
            my life. I’m so incredibly thankful for you and it’s never actually going to feel real that you’re mine Isabel. I’d do anything for you, always.

          <h2 class="display-2">Christmas Letter - December 25, 2024</h2>
          <h2 class="display-6">My sweetest love forever Isabel,</h2>
          <h2 class="display-6">
            Merry Christmas! I feel so lucky that I have been able to spend the holiday season with the treasure of the world and how perfectly everything has went. It’s
            bittersweet that it’s ending but now I can look forward to our future holidays even more. You seriously never need to get me anything as you are the perfect
            gift in itself. It’s so difficult for me to show how much I appreciate you and how treasured you are to me. I never want you to be afraid to tell how you feel or
            how you think. I always keep reiterating that I will do anything for you always, hoping that could even minimally show how much you are to me. All of our dates
            this season have felt so amazing with you and I can’t wait for infinitely more forever.</h2>
